'''
Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the
sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be
computed using the formula:
sum =
(n)(n + 1)/2
'''
print("The programs starts from here...")

n = int(input("Enter the positive integer : "))

sum  = (n * n+1) /2

print("The sum of first and positive integer is ",sum )
